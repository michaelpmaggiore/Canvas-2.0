TITLE:
Michael Maggiore, Section E
Project name: Colorado School of Mine's Grade Booklet

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
You can track each students' assignment grade and
have more control over your students' grade and what
they need to improve on. I created a program that stores
the teacher's students' information into a neat format so that they
can easily access it and see where their students are at.

PROBLEM DOCUMENTATION:
To run this program, use your makefile and compile this code 
follow the instructions that are on the screen.
You can create a student, class, and assignment for
each individual student.


DATA STRUCTURE:
I utilizes vectors and stored multiple objects as a student,
class, and assignment.
I stored the user's students into a vector list.

TESTS:
I first tested the name, class name, assignment name, were all correct.
This was by using strings, specifically inserting valid strings and getting correct results of the file being obtained properly within each private member function.


REFLECTIONS:
I learned how to utilize vectors and manipulate classes
by creating objects within each other, and storing them
as an object pointer.
